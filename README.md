## Developer Notes

```
As a developer I was tasked with refactoring a webpage for a marketing agency.
The webpage needed to meet accessibility standards so it can be optimized for search engines.
Changes were made to html file, css file, and application was deployed with github pages.
```

## Changes to HTML file made.

```
Refactored to meet accessibility standards.
Semantic HTML elements included.
Elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
Alt attributes added to all image elements.
Heading attributes fall in sequential order.
Concise and descriptive title element.
```
## Changes to CSS file made.

```
All application links properly working.
CSS selectors and properties consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.
CSS file properly commented.
```
